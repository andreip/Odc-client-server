How to run
==========

```bash
$ ant run   # in Odc-webservice, first run the server
$ ant run   # in Odc-client will start three simultaneous 
            # GUI clients, you can download files from one to another
            # one's home folder (see <seeing results> section)
```

Seeing results
----

You can then check in folder `Odc-client/res/<username>/` that a file has been copied from one user to another one. There is each user's home folder.
